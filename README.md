# Arx
Arx derives from latin to mean Dungeon;  
Arx is my first "real" python project in which I am attempting to make an all terminal text based game.  
  
My intention with the game is to be a pick your own adventure meets dungeons and dragons meets rpg  
in which you create a character and embark upon a journey that is random upon a path towards a set goal.
This being my first "real" project, I can always use some assistance;   
Please let me know if there are ways to improve my game or if you have any ideas to add.  
Thank you! :)
